# Introduction

PtFEM is a very versatile toolkit to construct FEM programs for practical engineering and scientific problems (to distinguish it somewhat from systems primarily focused on solving symbolic partial differential equations). Each chapter in the book gradually develops a set of related programs that can be used as a starting point for a particular type of problem.

PtFEM.jl is the central package in the Github [PtFEM organisation](https://github.com/PtFEM). More details on the plans for the PtFEM organisation are given in  [FUTURES](https://github.com/PtFEM/PtFEM.jl/blob/master/docs/src/FUTURES.md).
