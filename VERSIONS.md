## Version approach and history


### Approach

A version of a Julia package is labeled (tagged) as v"major.minor.patch".

My intention is to update the patch level whenever I make updates to programs which are not
visible to the then existing examples. This also includes adding new chapters and examples.

Changes that require updates to some examples bump the minor level.

Updates for new releases of Julia bump the major level.

### Version history

#### v"0.0.1"

Initial release of PtFEM/PtFEM.jl. Contains the programs in chapters 4, 5 and
the first 2 programs of chapter 6.
