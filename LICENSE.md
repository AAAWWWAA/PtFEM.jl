## Origin of these programs

The structure of PtFEM is directly derived from the Fortran programs that accompany the book ["Programming the Finite Element Method"](http://www.wiley.com//legacy/wileychi/smith_griffiths_margetts) by I M Smith, D V Griffiths and L Margetts.

The Julia versions have been derived by Rob Goedman and are contained in the Julia package PtFEM.jl.
